Indicators can be any of the following: 
 
Moving Average (MA) : The average of the past n values till today. 
Exponential Moving Average (EMA) : Gives more weightage to the most recent values 
while not discarding the older observation entirely. 
Rate of Change (ROC) : The ratio of the current price to the price n quotes earlier. 
n is generally 5 to 10 days. 
Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures the relative size of recent upward trends against 
the size of downward trends within the specified time interval (usually 9 – 14 days). 
 
For this Project, the EMA was considered as the primary indicator because of its ability 
to handle an almost infinite amount of past data, a trait that is very valuable in time series 
prediction (It is worth noting that the application of other indicators might result in better 
prediction accuracies for the stocks under consideration). 
 
EMA (t) = EMA (t-1) + alpha * (Price (t) - EMA (t-1)) 
 
Where, alpha = 2/ (N+1), Thus, for N=9, alpha = 0.20 
 
 
In theory, the Stock Prediction Problem can be considered as evaluating a function F at 
time T based on the previous values of F at times t-1,t-2,t-n while assigning 
corresponding weight function w at each point to F. 
 
F (t) = w1*F (t-1) + w2*F (t-2) + … + w*F (t-n)
